# Write a program to prompt the user for hours and rate per hour using input to compute gross pay.
# Pay should be the normal rate for hours up to 40 and time-and-a-half for the hourly rate for all hours worked above 40 hours. 
# Put the logic to do the computation of pay in a function called computepay() and use the function to do the computation.
# The function should return a value. 
# Use 45 hours and a rate of 10.50 per hour to test the program (the pay should be 498.75). 
# You should use input to read a string and float() to convert the string to a number. 
# Do not worry about error checking the user input unless you want to - you can assume the user types numbers properly. 
# Do not name your variable sum or use the sum() function.
